# Welcome to my Portfolio! 🚀

This repository contains my personal portfolio.
I initially created it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but later I migrated the entire project to React, making the code more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, with deployment handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-  React: Component-based development.
-  CSS: Responsive and modern styling.
-  JavaScript (ES6+): Logic and interactivity.
-  GitHub Actions: Automated deployment and quality checks.

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Features

✅ Automated Code Validation: GitHub Actions automatically validates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code using tools like HTMLHint, Stylelint, and ESLint to ensure high code quality and consistency.

✅ Broken Link Detection: GitHub Actions uses Lychee Action to check all internal and external links on the site to ensure there are no broken (404) links.

✅ Automated Deployment: Every time changes are pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions triggers the deployment process to GitHub Pages, ensuring that the site is always up-to-date without manual intervention.
