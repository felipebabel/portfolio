# Welcome to my Portfolio! 🚀

This repository contains my personal portfolio.
I initially created it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but later I migrated the entire project to React, making the code more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-  React: Component-based development.
-  CSS: Responsive and modern styling.
-  JavaScript (ES6+): Logic and interactivity.
